# Front End Tasks in the Test:

Hello, I'm Jaime Ramis Barber and as I was told in the mail I have only done the Front End part of this mobile application. In this document I will explain how I have done this task and my impressions.  Let's go!!

## 1. Document Structure:

As you can see I have decided to use a file structure putting everything in its corresponding folder except the two HTML pages since it seemed too little to put them separately and it was easier to do it this way.

**Note:** In a real big project it would have its own corresponding HTML folders.

The project has one CSS file, two JS files and two HTML files in total. Plus a folder with all the images used in this test.

## 2. HTML:

Since I am only judged in the front end area, I have created a structure in order to be able to dynamise the whole site in the future.

Classes have been used to modify styles and ID's for JavaScript. Apart from that it is all commented and structured.

## 3. CSS:

Although I know how to use SASS I decided not to use it in the project as it was not clear in the requirements if it could be used. In the end I decided to use pure CSS to style the page. 

The most important thing to comment is that MediaQueries have been used to adapt it to all the mobile devices that appear in the big browsers (Chrome, Firefox...). I have also used mainly the rem method for large scales, pixels for small scales and percentages for the main boxes of some parts of the app.



## 4. JavaScript:

The most important part of the project has been created from the Javascript language, namely the requested changes to the colours and the creation of a simple messaging chat as I do not have the skills to create a fully functional chat as it requires many other factors such as PHP and databases.

In this test I have decided not to use JQuery in order to further develop my skills with vanilla JS. No frameworks such as Angular or React have been used in this test.



## 5. Future Improvements:

- Creation of CSS animations to give more dynamism to the page.
- Using PHP and databases create dynamic HTML sections with JS such as: User name, location, profile picture, description.
- I have not managed to complete the task of saving the chat conversation history, I deduce that something more than JS is needed to be able to do it.
- In order to adapt the app to desktop and iPad devices, a separate mobile plan will be required, which will go through a process of: Ideation, UI design and its future implementation to code. The mobile version and the desktop version will be created separately for more efficiency.



## 6. Personal conclusions:

As I always say, an exercise can be done in many ways and the structure I have proposed can certainly be improved in all areas. 

In general I had a good time with the exercise and it is the first time that I am messing around with the creation of WhatsApp style chat, so I have learned something new, at least the first part. 

I hope it will be enough to balance the scales in my favour, otherwise I will take away the experience and the satisfaction of having been able to participate in the process. 

Thank you very much for the opportunity and may the force be with you!
Best regards.

Jaime Jesus Ramis Barber.
